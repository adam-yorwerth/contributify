# Contributify
These days linking to github profiles in CVs is common practice among developers. So why not greet your future employer with a nice message?

Contributify creates empty commits in a repository which, when visualized on github, displays a certain text.

# Example
`./contributify.sh --repo /path/to/my/repo HELLO` (you might need to run this multiple times depending on how many contributions you already have)
